# Privacy Policy & Data Security

At Nizukshya labs, we genuinely care about the protection of your data and privacy. We prioritize the security and confidentiality of your personally identifiable information (like your name, address, email address, and other identifiable details). Rest assured that we take the necessary measures to ensure your data remains safe and secure with us. Your trust means a lot to us, and we are committed to upholding the highest standards of privacy and data protection.

## Overview

Nizukshya Labs offers hosted services called "Cloud Apps" designed for Atlassian Cloud Products. These Cloud Apps are developed and delivered using the Atlassian Forge App Framework ("Atlassian Forge") or Atlassian Connect App framework ("Atlassian Connect"). You can easily identify our Cloud Apps by looking for the "Cloud Apps" category in the relevant Atlassian Marketplace listing.

## Data Security

At Nizukshya Labs, we place a high priority on data security and employ advanced technical and organizational measures to safeguard your Personal Data. Our security measures are regularly reviewed and updated to align with the latest industry standards. We continuously strive to ensure that your data remains protected and secure. If you have any inquiries or would like more details about our data security practices, please feel free to reach out to us. We would be more than happy to provide you with further information about our comprehensive data security concept.

## Cloud Apps (Forge)

**Atlassian Forge is an app framework that prioritizes security and privacy.**

Apps developed using the Forge framework are hosted exclusively on Atlassian servers. This ensures that all app data is stored in a secure environment managed by Atlassian. As part of their hosting services, Atlassian Forge handles essential functions such as authentication, authorization, software execution, and data management. The storage location for app data aligns with your Jira or Confluence Cloud region, guaranteeing data localization and adherence to regional regulations. By entrusting your data to Atlassian's robust infrastructure, we ensure the highest level of professionalism and security for your app data.

Apps built using Atlassian Forge:
- Simple Checklist For Jira
- Markdown Importer For Confluence

## Data Storage

By default, our Cloud Apps do not store Customer Data locally. Instead, the Customer Data is stored within the respective Atlassian Cloud Product. We follow this practice to ensure that your data remains within the secure environment provided by Atlassian. For detailed information about the security measures implemented by the Atlassian Cloud Product, we encourage you to refer to the Atlassian Cloud Product Security Statement. It provides comprehensive insights into the security protocols and measures employed to protect your data within the Atlassian Cloud ecosystem.

** Exceptions apply to all our Cloud Apps:**

- **Account Data**: Our Cloud Apps store data provided and generated by Atlassian, which is necessary for license validation, contract administration, and communication with the customer instance. This includes AddOnKey, ProductType, ClientKey, BaseUrl, ServiceEntitlementNumber, SharedSecret, and OauthClientId. Please note that we retain this data as a technical requirement for Atlassian Cloud Apps to function properly. Any installation metadata is deleted within 180 days after the customer unsubscribes from the service (refer to the "End of Subscription" section below).

We handle all data with utmost care and in compliance with applicable privacy laws and regulations to ensure the confidentiality and security of your information.

## Access to Customer Data

Access to Customer Data is restricted to authorized Nizukshya Labs employees and subcontractors who are part of our support and development teams. These individuals undergo a thorough screening process and are bound by strict confidentiality agreements. We ensure that our subcontractors are contractually obligated to uphold the same high standards of data security and privacy that we maintain. This ensures that your Customer Data is accessed only by trusted personnel who require it for the purposes of providing support and improving our services.

## End of Subscription

If a customer decides to unsubscribe from our Cloud App, we promptly initiate the process of deleting their stored Customer Data. Generally, this data is removed within a maximum of 180 days if the customer does not resubscribe. However, we are happy to accommodate customers who wish to have their data deleted earlier. Simply reach out to us, and we will expedite the deletion process according to your preferences.

If you have any additional questions or concerns regarding our data security and privacy practices, we encourage you to contact us. We are here to address any inquiries you may have and provide you with further information and clarification. Your privacy and data security are of utmost importance to us, and we are committed to ensuring that your concerns are promptly and thoroughly addressed. Please don't hesitate to reach out to us for any further assistance you may need.
