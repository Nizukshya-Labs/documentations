# End User License Agreement (EULA)

This EULA is a binding legal agreement between Nizukshya Labs, a provider of downloadable and cloud-based applications under Nizukshya Labs brand name through the Atlassian Marketplace or any other means that interoperate with applicable products manufactured by Atlassian Pty Ltd (“Atlassian”), and you (either an individual or a single legal entity as the details provided to Licensor upon purchase (hereinafter “Licensee” or “you”)) for the materials accompanying this EULA, including the accompanying computer software, associated media, printed materials, and any “online” or electronic documentation.

By clicking on the “I agree” (or similar button) that is presented to you at the time of your order, or by installing, copying, downloading, or otherwise using the Software, you agree to be bound by the terms of this EULA. Once you agree to this EULA on behalf of a company or other organization, you acknowledge that you have the authority to bind that company or organization to this EULA, and the terms Licensee. If you do not have that authority, you may not install, copy, download, or otherwise use the Software. This is a “Publisher EULA” as referred to in the [Atlassian Marketplace Terms of Use](https://www.atlassian.com/licensing/marketplace/termsofuse).

## 1. Scope of the Agreement

This EULA governs (a) Licensor’s commercially available downloadable software products sold or made available at no charge (“Software”), (b) Licensor’s Software provided in a hosted or cloud-based environment (“Hosted Services”), and (c) any support services provided by Licensor relating to the Software or Hosted Services. Software and Hosted Services, together with related Documentation, are referred to herein as “Products”.

## 2. Account Registration

You may need to register on the Atlassian Marketplace [https://marketplace.atlassian.com](https://marketplace.atlassian.com) in order to place orders or access or receive any Products. Any registration information that you provide must be accurate, current, and complete. You must also update your information so that Licensor may send notices, statements, and other information to you by email or through your account. You are responsible for all actions taken through your accounts.

## 3. Orders

Your order through the Atlassian Marketplace or with an authorized Reseller (“Order”) will specify your authorized scope of use for the Products, which may include: (a) the defined number of installations, the number of specific individuals for whom you have paid the required fees and whom you designate through the applicable Product (“Authorized Users”), the number of authorized servers, the number of unique data set platforms, and/or other defined resource utilization limitations, (b) storage or capacity (for Hosted Services), (c) numbers of licenses, copies, or instances (for Software), or (d) other restrictions or billable units (all of the above, as applicable, the “Scope of Use”). The term “Order” also includes any applicable Product or Support Services renewal or purchases you make to increase or upgrade your Scope of Use. You may increase the number of Authorized Users permitted to access your instance of the Product by placing a new Order or, in some cases, directly through the Product.

## 4. Grant of License

The Products are licensed, not sold, and no ownership right is conveyed to you, irrespective of the use of terms in this EULA such as “purchase” or “sale”.

This EULA grants you the following rights:

- Standard Use. For other than No-Charge Products, the Licensor grants you a perpetual (subject to termination for breach), worldwide, non-exclusive, non-transferable, non-sub licensable license to install and use the Software in object code only, limited to the Scope of Use as designated in your Order.
- Hosted Services. The Licensor grants you a monthly (paid in advance) subscription for worldwide, non-exclusive, non-transferable, non-sub licensable use of the Hosted Services, subject to automatic renewal for successive monthly terms unless either Licensor or you notifies the other of non-renewal or Licensor ceases to make a particular Hosted Service available. If you cancel, your subscription will terminate at the end of the then-current billing cycle, but you will not be entitled to any credits or refunds for amounts accrued or paid prior to such termination. You acknowledge that Hosted Services are on-line, subscription-based products, hosted by Licensor and/or Atlassian, and that Licensor and/or Atlassian may make changes to the Hosted Services from time to time.
- No-Charge Products. The Licensor may offer you a time-limited, worldwide, non-exclusive, non-transferable, non-sublicensable limited license for certain Products at no charge, including free accounts, trial use, and access to Beta Versions as defined below (“No-Charge Products”). Your use of No-Charge Products is subject to any additional terms specified by Licensor and is only permitted for the evaluation period designated by Licensor. After the evaluation period is expired you must abide by the Standard Use rights, or must remove and delete all copies of the Software in your possession. You may not use No-Charge Products for competitive analysis or similar purposes. Licensor may terminate your right to use No-Charge Products at any time and for any reason in its sole discretion, without liability to you. You understand that any pre-release and beta products (“Beta Versions”) are still under development, may be inoperable or incomplete and are likely to contain more errors and bugs than generally available Products. Licensor makes no promises that any Beta Versions will ever be made generally available. In some circumstances, Licensor may charge a fee in order to allow you to access Beta Versions, but the Beta Versions will still remain subject to this paragraph. All information regarding the characteristics, features or performance of Beta Versions constitutes Licensor’s Confidential Information. To the maximum extent permitted by applicable law, Licensor disclaims all obligations or liabilities with respect to No-Charge Products, including any Support Services, warranty, and indemnity obligations.

- Your license rights under this EULA are non-exclusive, non-transferable and non-sublicensable. You may not sell, transfer or convey the Software to any third party without Licensor’s prior express written consent. Licensor reserves all rights not expressly granted to the Licensee in this EULA.
- Standard Use licensees are permitted to make one (1) copy of the Software for data protection, archiving and backup purposes only and for no other purpose.
- You may only install the Software and make the Software available for use on hardware systems owned, leased or controlled by you, or your third party service providers so long as you remain responsible for their compliance with the terms and conditions of this EULA.
- This EULA applies whether you purchase Products directly from Licensor, through the Atlassian marketplace, through an authorized Reseller or otherwise. If you purchase through a Reseller, your license rights shall be as stated in the Order placed by Reseller for you, and the Reseller is responsible for the accuracy of any such Order. Resellers are not authorized to make any promises or commitments on Licensor’s behalf, and Licensor is not bound by any obligations to you other than what is included in this EULA.

## 5. Third-Party Products

- You acknowledge the Products may contain software licensed by Licensor from third parties, including open source software, and embedded in the Products, and that in addition to the obligations of this EULA, additional obligations may apply in relation to any use of the third party software by you which is not in accordance with the use of the Products as permitted under the terms of this EULA. In such circumstances you must consult the relevant third party to acquire any necessary licenses and consents in relation to your use of the third party software.
- The Software uses, requires and depends on various third party APIs. Licensor disclaims any liability for any failure or limitations of these APIs or services. Atlassian, or any other API provider, may remove the API end points required for the Software to function properly. Licensor disclaims any liability for the consequence of such actions by such third parties.

## 6. Price and Payment

If you are not using a free product, you must pay the license fee within the period indicated in the applicable invoice or as otherwise provided in Licensor’s pricing terms as published on the Atlassian Marketplace. Failure to pay any license fees by the due date will result in the immediate termination of the license(s) granted under this EULA.

## 7. Support Services

- Licensor may provide you with online support services related to the Products (“Support Services”), in its discretion and for the sole purpose of addressing technical issues relating to the use of the Products. Support Services also include installation, troubleshooting problems with our apps, identifying intermediate solutions. When accepted by you, any such Releases will be considered part of the Products and subject to the terms of this EULA.
- The Initial Support Period for each Product is for twelve (12) months starting at the time each Product is purchased, and may be renewed for additional twelve (12) month periods (each, a “Renewal Support Period”) at the then-current rate for Support Services. Renewal Support Periods commence upon the expiration of the prior Support Period regardless of when the Product is purchased.
- Use of Support Services, if any, is governed by Licensor’s policies and programs described in any user manual, in online documentation, and/or other Licensor-provided materials. Any supplemental software code provided to you as a part of Support Services will be considered part of the Products and subject to the terms of this EULA.
- All deliveries of Software will be electronic. For the avoidance of doubt, you are responsible for the installation of any Software.
- Licensor encourages feedback from its customers. If you have any feedback regarding your purchase or use of the Products, please provide that feedback to Licensor at [info@nizukshya.com](mailto:info@nizukshya.com).
